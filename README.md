# RUSTSCIIDOTS

An implementation of the [Asciidots Esolang](https://github.com/aaronjanse/asciidots) in Rust!
Why? Because I can!

## Notes:
- I have never written an interpreter before, I've implemented this purely from how I thought it would be done, without any reference to the original interpreter's implementation in python
- If you have qualms with any of these implementations of asciidots and think there are ways it can be done better, by all means tell me! I wrote this project as a way to learn rust, so I want to get better at rust.
- I love you :-)
